# COVID-19-Hospital-Management-System

As the number of infections caused by the spread of the Coronavirus continues to rise
worldwide, this problem statement aims at Creating a COVID-19 patients management
and tracking web application for a Hospital. The user/admin will enter the Name,
Address, Current COVID19 Symptoms, Contact Details, Health Details and other
details of the patient and will assign the bed to the respective patient. Only the
management can insert and modify the patient data and health status of the patient.
It also has dashboard for hospital management where they can see the status of
the recovered, admitted and deceased patients and bed availability.
